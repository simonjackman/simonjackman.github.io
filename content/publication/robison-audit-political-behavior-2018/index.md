abstract: What are the most important concepts in the political behavior literature?
  Have experiments supplanted surveys as the dominant method in political behavior
  research? What role does the American National Election Studies (ANES) play in this
  literature? We utilize a content analysis of over 1,100 quantitative articles on
  American mass political behavior published between 1980 and 2009 to address these
  questions. We then supplement this with a second sample of articles published between
  2010 and 2018. Four key takeaways are apparent. First, the agenda of this literature
  is heavily skewed toward understanding voting to a relative lack of attention to
  specific policy attitudes and other topics. Second, experiments are ascendant, but
  are far from displacing surveys, and particularly the ANES. Third, while important
  changes to this agenda have occurred over time, it remains much the same in 2018
  as it was in 1980. Fourth, the centrality of the ANES seems to stem from its time-series
  component. In the end, we conclude that the ANES is a critical investment for the
  scientific community and a main driver of political behavior research.
