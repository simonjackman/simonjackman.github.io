abstract: "We propose a mathematical framework for modeling opinion change using large-scale\
  \ longitudinal data sets. Our framework encompasses two varieties of Bayesian learning\
  \ theory as well as Mannheim's theory of generational responses to political events.\
  \ The basic assumptions underlying the model are (1) that historical periods are\
  \ characterized by shocks to existing political opinions, and (2) that individuals\
  \ of different ages may attach different weights to those political shocks. Political\
  \ generations emerge endogenously from these basic assumptions: the political views\
  \ of identifiable birth cohorts differ, and evolve distinctively through time, due\
  \ to the interaction of age-specific weights with period-specific shocks. We employ\
  \ this model to examine generational changes in party identification using survey\
  \ data from the 1952â€“ 2008 American National Election Studies."
