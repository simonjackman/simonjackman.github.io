abstract: '[Social scientists almost always use statistical models positing the dependent
  variable as a global, linear function of X, despite suspicions that the social and
  political world is not so simple, or that our theories are so strong. Generalized
  additive models (GAMs) let researchers fit each independent variable with arbitrary
  nonparametric functions, but subject to the constraint that the nonparametric effects
  combine additively. In this way GAMs strike a sensible balance between the flexibility
  of nonparametric techniques and the ease of interpretation and familiarity of linear
  regression. GAMs thus offer social scientists a practical methodology for improving
  on the extant practice of global linearity by default. We reanalyze published work
  from several subfields of political science, highlighting the strengths (and limitations)
  of GAMs. We estimate non-linear marginal effects in a regression analysis of incumbent
  reelection, nonparametric duration dependence in an analysis of cabinet duration,
  and within-dyad interaction effects in a reconsideration of the democratic peace
  hypothesis. We conclude with a more general consideration of the circumstances in
  which GAMs are likely to be of use to political scientists, as well as some apparent
  limitations of the technique.]'
