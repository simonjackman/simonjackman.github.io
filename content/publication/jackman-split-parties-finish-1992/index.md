abstract: 'The 1957 election is a watershed in Queensland politics. Coming after the
  Labor split, the election saw the end of over 40 years of almost uninterrupted Labor
  rule in Queensland. Often overlooked in discussions of this key period is that the
  1957 election was conducted under plurality rule, or as it is more commonly known,
  ?first?past?the?post?. Had the 1957 election been held under preferential voting,
  preferences would have been distributed in 46 of the 71 contested seats. Through
  simulations of distributions of hypothetical second preferences I assess the effects
  of the Labor split on the fates of the respective parties. Contrary to some interpretations
  of the 1957 election I find that plurality rule saved Labor from even greater electoral
  losses than those they would have sustained under preferential voting. Single?member
  constituency electoral systems deal harsh punishment to small parties, or, as in
  1957, split parties: a point well known by astute political leaders. Preferential
  voting may have given Labor leaders even more powerful incentives to heal the split
  of 1957, and perhaps even avoid it in the first place.'
