abstract: "? Abstract?Bayesian data analysis relies on Bayes' Theorem, using data\
  \ to update prior beliefs about parameters. In this review I introduce and contrast\
  \ Bayesian analysis with conventional frequentist inference and then distinguish\
  \ two types of Bayesian analysis in political science. First, Bayesian analysis\
  \ is used to merge historical information with current data in an analysis of likely\
  \ election outcomes in Florida in 2000; particular attention is paid to the sensitivity\
  \ of the results to the choice of prior (i.e., how much confidence one places in\
  \ the historical information). Second, a more ?modern? style of Bayesian analysis\
  \ is reviewed, relying on Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to generate computationally\
  \ intensive ?random tours? of the high dimensional posterior distributions that\
  \ are the focus of many contemporary Bayesian analyses; the example used is a central\
  \ problem in political science, the analysis of legislators' preferences using roll\
  \ call data."
