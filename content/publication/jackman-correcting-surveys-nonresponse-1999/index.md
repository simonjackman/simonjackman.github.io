abstract: Surveys often yield estimates that are suspected to be biased, because of
  either non-response bias and/or measurement error. Numerous methods exist for eliminating
  non-response bias (e.g., re-weighting the data, individual-level models of selection,
  or deriving bounds on the true population parameter). But in many settings these
  methods may not be tractable or helpful, and usually ignore measurement error. I
  propose a method for dealing with both non-response bias and measurement error simultaneously,
  when using surveys to estimate rates or proportions. The method exploits `auxiliary
  information' from analogous surveys, where it is possible to derive the relative
  amount of non-response bias and measurement error. I demonstrate the method in the
  case of voter turnout, where a reasonably large body of vote validation studies
  supply auxiliary information, allowing the components of bias in survey estimates
  of turnout rates to be isolated. Averaging over the auxiliary information provides
  bounds on the quantity of interest, yielding an estimate corrected for both non-response
  bias and measurement error.
