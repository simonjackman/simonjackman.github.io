abstract: Carroll et al. (2009) summarize the similarities and differences between
  the NOMINATE and IDEAL methods of fitting spatial voting models to binary roll-call
  data. As those authors note, for the class of problems with which either NOMINATE
  and the Bayesian quadratic-normal model can be used, the ideal point estimates almost
  always coincide, and when they do not, the discrepancy is due to the somewhat arbitrary
  identification and computational constraints imposed by each method. There are,
  however, many problems for which the Bayesian quadratic-normal model can be easily
  generalized, so as to address a broad array of questions and take advantage of additional
  data. Given the nature and source of the differences between NOMINATE and the Bayesian
  approach?as well as the fact that both approaches are approximations of the decision-making
  processes being modeled?we believe that it is preferable to choose the more flexible
  Bayesian approach.
