abstract: We apply formal, statistical measurement models to the Polity indicators,
  used widely in studies of international relations to measure democracy. In so doing,
  we make explicit the hitherto implicit assumptions underlying scales built using
  the Polity indicators. Modeling democracy as a latent variable allows us to assess
  the ?noise? (measurement error) in the resulting measure. We show that this measurement
  error is considerable and has substantive consequences when using a measure of democracy
  as an independent variable in cross-national statistical analyses. Our analysis
  suggests that skepticism as to the precision of the Polity democracy scale is well
  founded and that many researchers have been overly sanguine about the properties
  of the Polity democracy scale in applied statistical work.
