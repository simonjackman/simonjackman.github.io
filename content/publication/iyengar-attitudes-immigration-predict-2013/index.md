abstract: This paper demonstrates that citizens in seven advanced industrialized democracies
  generally oppose more open immigration policies, but stand ready to admit individual
  immigrants. Using an experimental design, we demonstrate the applicability of the
  ``person-positivity bias'' to immigration and investigate the effects of economic
  and cultural ``deservingness'' on evaluations of individual immigrants. Our results
  show that immigrants from professional backgrounds elicit higher levels of support
  than unskilled workers. The bias against unskilled workers is enlarged among immigrants
  accompanied by families. In comparison with occupational status and the number of
  family dependents, the target immigrant's cultural attributes— as measured by Middle
  Eastern nationality and Afrocentric appearance— prove relatively inconsequential
  as criteria for evaluating immigrants.
