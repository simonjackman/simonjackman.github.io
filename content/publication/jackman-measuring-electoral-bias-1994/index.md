abstract: Electoral systems translate citizens' votes into seats in the legislature,
  and are thus critical components of democracies. But electoral systems can be unfair,
  insulating incumbents from adverse electoral trends, or biasing the mapping of votes
  to seats in favour of one party. I assess methods for measuring bias and responsiveness
  in electoral systems, highlighting the limitations of the popular `multi-year' and
  `uniform swing' methods. I advocate an approach that incorporates constituency-level
  and jurisdiction-wide variation in party's vote shares. I show how this method can
  be used to elaborate both the extent and consequences of malapportionment. I then
  present election-by-election estimates of partisan bias and responsiveness for ninety-three
  state and federal elections in Australia since 1949. The empirical results reported
  show that the coalition parties have generally `out-biased' the Australian Labor
  party, despite some notable pro-ALP biases. The overall extent of partisan bias
  in Australian electoral systems, however, has generally diminished in magnitude
  over time.
