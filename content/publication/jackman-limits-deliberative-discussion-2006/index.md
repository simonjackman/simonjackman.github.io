abstract: 'Can citizens learn from talking politics with one another? To bring out
  the logic of deliberation, we focus on a simplified model of political discussion:
  a one-exchange argument. Our model rests on three conditions, all commonly satisfied
  in real life: (1) that only two alternatives are open for choice?support or opposition
  to a policy; (2) that as political sophistication increases, so too does the probability
  that citizens will choose the policy alternative more consonant with their most
  thoroughly considered view of the matter; and (3) that arguments on opposing sides
  of an issue are of equal quality. Taking advantage of a specially designed experiment
  embedded in a large public opinion survey in France, we find that the proportion
  of citizens choosing policy alternatives consonant with their more general ideological
  orientations does not increase over the course of our experiment. In the aggregate,
  we find that deliberation leads at least as many people to ideologically inconsistent
  positions as it helps people find their way to ideologically consistent positions.
  In this sense, we find that deliberation is for naught.'
