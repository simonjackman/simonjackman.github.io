abstract: Scoring lawmakers based upon the votes they cast while serving in Congress
  is both commonplace and politically consequential. However, scoring legislators'
  voting records is not without its problemsâ€” even when performed by organizations
  without a specific policy agenda. A telling illustration of the impact that these
  scores have on political debate recently arose in the 2004 Democratic presidential
  primaries.
