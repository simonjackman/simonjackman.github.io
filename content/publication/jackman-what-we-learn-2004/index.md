abstract: What do we really know about applicants to graduate school? How much information
  is in an applicant's file? What do we learn by having graduate admissions committees
  read and score applicant files? In this article, I develop a statistical model for
  measuring applicant quality, combining the information in the committee members'
  ordinal ratings with the information in applicants' GRE scores. The model produces
  estimates of applicant quality purged of the influence of committee members' preferences
  over ostensibly extraneous applicant characteristics, such as gender and intended
  field of study. An explicitly Bayesian approach is adopted for estimation and inference,
  making it straightforward to obtain confidence intervals not only on latent applicant
  quality but over rank orderings of applicants and the probability of belonging in
  a set of likely admittees. Using data from applications to a highly ranked political
  science graduate program, I show that there is considerable uncertainty in estimates
  of applicant quality, making it impossible to make authoritative distinctions as
  to quality among large portions of the applicant pool. The multiple rater model
  I develop here is extremely flexible and has applications in fields as diverse as
  judicial politics, legislative politics, international relations, and public opinion.
