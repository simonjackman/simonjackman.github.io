abstract: Multimember districts (MMDs) were widespread in U.S. state legislatures
  as recently as 1970, yet little information is available about them. We provide
  information about their frequency, distribution, types, and sizes, the degree to
  which they are contested, and the extent to which incumbents run in them and are
  reelected. We then indicate how to calculate vote margins in MMDs. The method is
  to create pseudo-pairs by matching the Democratic candidate who has the highest
  vote with the Republican candidate who has the lowest vote, the Democratic candidate
  who has the second highest vote with the Republican who has the second-lowest vote,
  and so on.
