abstract: We develop a Bayesian procedure for estimation and inference for spatial
  models of roll call voting. This approach is extremely flexible, applicable to any
  legislative setting, irrespective of size, the extremism of the legislators' voting
  histories, or the number of roll calls available for analysis. The model is easily
  extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of roll call data,
  such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party
  whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, and the evolution of the legislative
  agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates
  of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test
  models embodying alternate assumptions (e.g., log-rolling, party discipline). A
  Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference
  with roll call data that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation
  methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis
  tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models.
  In a series of examples we show how our method is easily extended to accommodate
  theoretically interesting models of legislative behavior. Our goal is to provide
  a statistical framework for combining the measurement of legislative preferences
  with tests of models of legislative behavior.
