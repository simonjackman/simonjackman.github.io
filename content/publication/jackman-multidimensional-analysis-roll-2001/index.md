abstract: "Vote-specific parameters are often by-products of roll call analysis, the\
  \ primary goal being the measurement of legislators' ideal points. But these vote-specific\
  \ parameters are more important in higher-dimensional settings: prior restrictions\
  \ on vote parameters help identify the model, and researchers often have prior beliefs\
  \ about the nature of the dimensions underlying the proposal space. Bayesian methods\
  \ provide a straightforward and rigorous way for incorporating these prior beliefs\
  \ into roll call analysis. I demonstrate this by exploiting the close connections\
  \ among roll call analysis, item-response models, and ``full-information'' factor\
  \ analysis. Vote-specific discrimination parameters are equivalent to factor loadings,\
  \ and as in factor analysis, they (1) enable researchers to discern the substantive\
  \ content of the recovered dimensions, (2) can be used for assessing dimensionality\
  \ and model checking, and (3) are an obvious vehicle for introducing and testing\
  \ researchers' prior beliefs about the dimensions. Bayesian simulation facilitates\
  \ these uses of discrimination parameters, by simplifying estimation and inference\
  \ for the massive number of parameters generated by roll call analysis."
