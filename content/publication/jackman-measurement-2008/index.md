abstract: 'The success of measurement — the quality of the inferences provided by
  a measurement model — is usually assessed with reference to two key concepts: validity
  and reliability. The distinct uses of measures of latent variables are reported.
  The article then deals with the costs of ignoring measurement error. Additionally,
  a quick introduction to factor analysis, item-response models, and a very general
  class of latent variable models are briefly given. Moreover, it describes the inference
  for discrete latent variables and the measurement in a dynamic setting.'
