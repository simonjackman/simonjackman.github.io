abstract: 'Compulsory voting (CV) is a system of laws and/or norms mandating that
  enfranchised citizens turn out to vote, often accompanied by (a) a system of compulsory
  voter registration, and (b) penalties for non-compliance, usually fines or the denial
  of state-provided benefits. CV is widespread throughout Latin America, but somewhat
  rarer among industrialized democracies. Cross-national studies find CV to be an
  effective mechanism for increasing turnout, by between seven and sixteen percentage
  points; within-country comparisons also generally find that CV boosts turnout. CV
  is commonly thought to advantage parties of the left (based on social-structural
  and demographic patterns of turnout in countries without CV), and hence also shift
  public policy in that direction. But these conjectures are difficult to verify,
  since other political and institutional variables intervene between voter turnout,
  election outcomes and policy outputs. Fines and sanctions are just one aspect of
  CV: states employing CV usually reciprocate by reducing the costs of turnout for
  its citizens, via weekend voting, simple registration procedures, and the creation
  of a centralized, professional bureaucracy concerned with all aspects of election
  administration.'
