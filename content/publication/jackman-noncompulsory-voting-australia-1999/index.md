abstract: Compulsory voting has come under close scrutiny in recent Australian political
  debate. Conventional wisdom maintains that a repeal of compulsory voting would result
  in a sizeable electoral boost for the conservative Coalition parties; the proportion
  of Coalition voters who would not voluntarily turn out is thought to be smaller
  than the corresponding proportion of Labor Party voters. But these estimates rely
  on methods hampered by critical shortcomings, and so the conventional wisdom is
  easily challenged or dismissed. I examine the use of surveys in assessing the counter-factual
  of non-compulsory voting, focusing on the 1996 Australian Election Study. While
  turnout is compulsory in Australia, responding to surveys isn't; people who respond
  to surveys generally have more interest in politics than non-respondents, so it
  is unsurprising that survey respondents report a voluntary turnout rate approaching
  90%. Respondents also tend to exaggerate the probability that they would voluntarily
  turn out. I draw on examples where the effects of survey non-response and over-reporting
  on estimates of turnout have been estimated (including the NES vote validation studies).
  Using these examples as a guide, I find that surveys overestimate the voluntary
  turnout rates likely to be encountered in Australia (55% to 70%, versus the survey
  estimate of 88.8%), and the extent to which a fall in turnout would work to the
  advantage of the Coalition parties. The Liberal Party still appears to benefit from
  a shift to voluntary turnout, though these gains are not as large as the conventional
  wisdom suggests.
