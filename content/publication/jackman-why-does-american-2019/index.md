abstract: 'Surveys are a key tool for understanding political behavior, but they are
  subject to biases that render their estimates about the frequency of socially desirable
  behaviors inaccurate. For decades the American National Election Study (ANES) has
  overestimated voter turnout, though the causes of this persistent bias are poorly
  understood. The face-to-face component of the 2012 ANES produced a turnout estimate
  at least 13 points higher than the benchmark voting-eligible population turnout
  rate. We consider three explanations for this overestimate in the survey: nonresponse
  bias, over-reporting and the possibility that the ANES constitutes an inadvertent
  mobilization treatment. Analysis of turnout data supplied by voter file vendors
  allows the three phenomena to be measured for the first time in a single survey.
  We find that over-reporting is the largest contributor, responsible for six percentage
  points of the turnout overestimate, while nonresponse bias and mobilization account
  for an additional 4 and 3 percentage points,  respectively.'
