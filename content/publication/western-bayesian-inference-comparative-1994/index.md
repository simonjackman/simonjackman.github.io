abstract: Regression analysis in comparative research suffers from two distinct problems
  of statistical inference. First, because the data constitute all the available observations
  from a population, conventional inference based on the long-run behavior of a repeatable
  data mechanism is not appropriate. Second, the small and collinear data sets of
  comparative research yield imprecise estimates of the effects of explanatory variables.
  We describe a Bayesian approach to statistical inference that provides a unified
  solution to these two problems. This approach is illustrated in a comparative analysis
  of unionization.
