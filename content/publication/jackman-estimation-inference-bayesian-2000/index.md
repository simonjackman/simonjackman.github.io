abstract: '[Bayesian statistics have made great strides in recent years, developing
  a class of methods for estimation and inference via stochastic simulation known
  as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. MCMC constitutes a revolution in statistical
  practice with effects beginning to be felt in the social sciences: models long consigned
  to the \"too hard\" basket are now within reach of quantitative researchers. I review
  the statistical pedigree of MCMC and the underlying statistical concepts. I demonstrate
  some of the strengths and weaknesses of MCMC and offer practical suggestions for
  using MCMC in social-science settings. Simple, illustrative examples include a probit
  model of voter turnout and a linear regression for time-series data with autoregressive
  disturbances. I conclude with a more challenging application, a multinomial probit
  model, to showcase the power of MCMC methods.]'
