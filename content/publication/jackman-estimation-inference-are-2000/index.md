abstract: "Bayesian simulation is increasingly exploited in the social sciences for\
  \ estimation and inference of model parameters. But an especially useful (if often\
  \ overlooked) feature of Bayesian simulation is that it can be used to estimate\
  \ any function of model parameters, including ``auxiliary'' quantities such as goodness-of-fit\
  \ statistics, predicted values, and residuals. Bayesian simulation treats these\
  \ quantities as if they were missing data, sampling from their implied posterior\
  \ densities. Exploiting this principle also lets researchers estimate models via\
  \ Bayesian simulation where maximum-likelihood estimation would be intractable.\
  \ Bayesian simulation thus provides a unified solution for quantitative social science.\
  \ I elaborate these ideas in a variety of contexts: these include generalized linear\
  \ models for binary responses using data on bill cosponsorship recently reanalyzed\
  \ in Political Analysis, itemâ€” response models for the measurement of respondent's\
  \ levels of political information in public opinion surveys, the estimation and\
  \ analysis of legislators' ideal points from roll-call data, and outlier-resistant\
  \ regression estimates of incumbency advantage in U.S. Congressional elections"
