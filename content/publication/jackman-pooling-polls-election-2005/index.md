abstract: Poll results vary over the course of a campaign election and across polling
  organisations, making it difficult to track genuine changes in voter support. I
  present a statistical model that tracks changes in voter support over time by pooling
  the polls, and corrects for variation across polling organisations due to biases
  known as ?house effects?. The result is a less biased and more precise estimate
  of vote intentions than is possible from any one poll alone. I use five series of
  polls fielded over the 2004 Australian federal election campaign (ACNielsen, the
  ANU/ninemsn online poll, Galaxy, Newspoll, and Roy Morgan) to generate daily estimates
  of the Coalition's share of two-party preferred (2PP) and first preference vote
  intentions. Over the course of the campaign there is about a 4 percentage point
  swing to the Coalition in first preference vote share (and a smaller swing in 2PP
  terms), that begins prior to the formal announcement of the election, but is complete
  shortly after the leader debates. The ANU/ninemsn online poll and Morgan are found
  to have large and statistically significant biases, while, generally, the three
  phone polls have small and/or statistically insignificant biases, with ACNielsen
  and (in particular) Galaxy performing quite well in 2004. * An earlier version of
  this paper was prepared for the annual meeting of the Australasian Political Studies
  Association, University of Adelaide, 29 September?1 October 2004.
