abstract: ". The Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) is the leading brief instrument\
  \ for the ``Big Five'' personality measurement. However, TIPI's design has suboptimal\
  \ features: agree-disagree response options, numeric instead of verbal response\
  \ labels, and multiple items per page. This paper presents a version of TIPI that\
  \ addresses these problems. Using two nationally representative sample surveys,\
  \ we compare the original and revised TIPIs on several dimensions: completion time,\
  \ item nonresponse, paired item reliability, and validity based on relations to\
  \ other variables. Completion time is the same and item nonresponse rates are low,\
  \ while reliability and criterion validity for the revised TIPI is better than the\
  \ original. The results show how better personality data can be obtained at no additional\
  \ cost by optimizing questionnaire design."
