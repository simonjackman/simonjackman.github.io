abstract: 'Campaigns, parties, interest groups, pollsters, and political scientists
  rely on voter-registration lists and consumer files to identify people as targets
  for registration drives, persuasion, and mobilization and to be included in sampling
  frames for surveys. We introduce a new category of Americans: the politically invisibleâ€”
  that is, people who are unreachable using these voter and marketing lists. Matching
  a high-quality, random sample of the US population to multiple lists reveals that
  at least 11% of the adult citizenry is unlisted. An additional 12% is mislisted
  (i.e., not living at their recorded address). These groups are invisible to list-based
  campaigns and research, making them difficult or impossible to contact. Two in five
  Blacks and (citizen) Hispanics are unreachable, but only 18% of whites. The unreachable
  are poorer than the reachable population, have markedly lower levels of political
  engagement, and are much less likely to report contact with candidates and campaigns.
  They are heavily Democratic in party identification and vote intention, favoring
  Obama versus Romney 73 to 27, with only 16% identifying as Republicans. That the
  politically invisible are more liberal and from historically marginalized groups
  shows that the turn to list-based campaigning and research could worsen existing
  biases in the political system.'
