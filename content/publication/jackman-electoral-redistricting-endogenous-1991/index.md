abstract: Recent efforts at estimating bias and responsiveness in electoral systems
  typically proceed by assigning observations to subsamples according to which party
  controlled the redistricting process. We show this traditional procedure to introduce
  selection bias into the resulting estimates of bias and responsiveness and present
  an alternative strategy for estimating these parameters. Using data from the state
  legislatures, and employing two different measures of partisan control of redistricting,
  we obtain results that modestly differ from those obtained with the traditional
  approach. Measures of control of redistricting utilizing information about the partisan
  intent of redistricting commissions and tribunals are exogenous to the seats-votes
  relationship.
