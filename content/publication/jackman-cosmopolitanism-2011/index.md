abstract: "On April 14, 2008, with Barack Obama only eight points behind her in the\
  \ polls and the Pennsylvania Democratic primary only days away, Hillary Clinton\
  \ downed a shot of whiskey and a beer at a campaign stop in Indiana. She was appealing\
  \ to working class Americans, those ``hardworking'' Americans she claimed could\
  \ not bring themselves to vote for the effete, well-educated Barack Obama.$^1$ \
  \ Clinton was capitalizing on revelations of remarks made by Obama at a closed-press\
  \ fundraising event in liberal San Francisco. Obama said:  You go into these small\
  \ towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in"
