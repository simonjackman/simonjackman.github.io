 abstract = {[We study the partisan effects of state legislative districting in the 1970s and 1980s for the lower houses of 47 states. We consider both partisan control of the state government and of the districting process itself, examining seat proportions immediately before and after redistricting as well as estimates of bias and responsiveness. The results indicate moderate but inconsistent effects of partisan control on both seat gains and bias. Findings are more uniform with respect to responsiveness: under all conditions of partisan control, seat changes are relatively unresponsive to vote changes. The results are consistent with recent findings about the effects of congressional districting and suggest that, in state legislatures as well as Congress, bipartisan efforts to minimize responsiveness may now be a greater concern than partisan gerrymandering.]},
