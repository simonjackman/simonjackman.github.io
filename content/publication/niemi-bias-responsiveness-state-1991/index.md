abstract: '[We study the partisan effects of state legislative districting in the
  1970s and 1980s for the lower houses of 47 states. We consider both partisan control
  of the state government and of the districting process itself, examining seat proportions
  immediately before and after redistricting as well as estimates of bias and responsiveness.
  The results indicate moderate but inconsistent effects of partisan control on both
  seat gains and bias. Findings are more uniform with respect to responsiveness: under
  all conditions of partisan control, seat changes are relatively unresponsive to
  vote changes. The results are consistent with recent findings about the effects
  of congressional districting and suggest that, in state legislatures as well as
  Congress, bipartisan efforts to minimize responsiveness may now be a greater concern
  than partisan gerrymandering.]'
