abstract: Studies of American politics, particularly legislative politics, rely heavily
  on measures of the partisanship of a district. We develop a measurement model for
  this concept, estimating partisanship in the absence of election-specific, short-term
  factors, such as national-level swings specific to particular elections, incumbency
  advantage, and home-state effects in presidential elections. We estimate the measurement
  model using electoral returns and district-level demographic characteristics spanning
  five decades (1952?2000), letting us assess how the distribution of district partisanship
  has changed over time, in response to population movements and redistricting, particularly
  via the creation of majority-minority districts. We validate the partisanship measure
  with an analysis of congressional roll-call data. The model is easily extended to
  incorporate other indicators of district partisanship, such as survey data.
