abstract: The link between economic conditions and election outcomes is a pillar of
  social science. Voters prefer ?better times? to worse and reward or punish incumbents
  accordingly. We investigate the extent to which this truism holds in the Australian
  context, with particular emphasis on the 1993 result. While Australian election
  outcomes are generally not well predicted by prevailing economic conditions, we
  are impressed by the extent to which the 1993 election outcome is at odds with the
  state of the economy. In particular, we find Labor performed up to five percentage
  points better than expected in 1993, making this result one of the most exceptional
  election results ever observed in Australia. The sizeable electoral penalty typically
  accompanying large increases in unemployment was effectively nullified in 1993.
  We accurately predict the 1993 result (ex post) only if unemployment is considered
  electorally irrelevant. We conclude by suggesting a research agenda for better understanding
  the link between economic context and election outcomes in the Australian setting.
