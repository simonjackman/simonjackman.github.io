I have three decades of professional experience as a researcher, teacher, mentor, leader and communicator, in political science and data science, in the United States and Australia.  

Born and raised in Australia, I moved to the US for doctoral studies at the University of Rochester and Princeton, before two decades of academic appointments at the University of Chicago and Stanford University.  I returned to Australia in 2015, and was the CEO of the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney for six years (2016-2022).  I am now an Honorary Professor with the University of Sydney.   

I am consulting data analyst and data strategist, with high-profile clients in politics, advocacy, media, academia and business.

My consulting work spans survey research, experimental design and analysis, statistical modelling, machine learning, natural language processing, data visualization.  Solutions I provide include:

- Informing strategy: identifying "targets of opportunity" and vulnerabilities in both political and commerical settings, optimal messaging and framing.   

- Close-to-real time tracking of voter or consumer sentiment, combining information from disparate sources to form best-in-class projections of to small geographic areas, offering tactical support for election or advocacy campaigns.

- Helping clients bring data into their decision-making, advising on hiring, IT, and processes.


Current projects:

- small-area estimation: inferring public opinion at the level of parliamentary seats/districts, postcodes, local government areas etc, from macro-level data.

- machine-learning methods for classifying and modelling large corpora of political text: identifying persuasive and persistent campaign messages and narratives, misinformation and disinformation, counter-narratives.
