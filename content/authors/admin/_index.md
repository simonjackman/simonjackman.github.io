I am a political scientist and data scientist.   Between 1996 and 2016 I was Professor of Political Science, and, by courtesy, of Statistics, at Stanford University.  I am a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (FASSA) and a Fellow and past-president of the Society for Political Methodology.   

I was one of the principal investigators of the American National Election Studies over the 2012 and 2016 election cycles and is currently one of the principal investigators of the Australian Election Survey, where my interests in politics, research design and data analysis come together.   I work on under-coverage, non-response bias and questionnaire design, so as to improve the validity and reliability of survey based social science.

I use Bayesian methods for computation and inference whenever is feasible.   I wrote a book on the topic (published in 2009) and have many published applications where Bayesian approaches have brought problems out of the "too hard" basket, including latent variable models for (1) inferring politicians' preferences from their legislative voting record; (2) combining noisy and/or "lumpy"" indicators of democracy for cross-country comparisons and rankings; (3) tracking public opinion and voting intentions over election campaigns.

My students and research assistants have gone on to careers at the world's leading academic institutions (e.g., Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley, UCLA, Duke, MIT, ANU), business (e.g., Facebook and Netflix) and in government.

I am currently working on problems in (1) small-area estimation or "cross-level" inference; (2) machine-learning methods for classification and modeling of text.

Between 2016 and 2022, I was Professor and CEO of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, Australia's leading institution for the analysis of the United States.

Over my career I have consulted for a wide array of media organisations around elections and for a wide range of commercial and NFP organisations, including serving as an expert witness for plaintiffs in gerrymandering litigation in the United States.   Please get in touch if I can be of assistance.
