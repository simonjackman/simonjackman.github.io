I have three decades of professional experience as a researcher, teacher, mentor, leader and communicator, in political science and data science, in the United States and Australia.

The **purpose of my research is to advance democracy** by making discoveries about democratic processes and their frailties through the rigorous analysis of data.

Questions I am working on include: 

- When and how do **illiberal attitudes and predispositions** --- such as authoritarianism and racial prejudice --- become politically salient, and with what consequences?  

- **What drives vote choice** in contemporary democracies?   Which issues or campaign messages prompt vote choices that reinforce or change voters' party loyalties? 

- **Are electoral systems fair** or do they help entrench a particular party or incumbents in office?

- How to rigorously **measure core concepts of democratic theory and practice**, such as democracy itself, electoral fairness, or attitudinal states (political ideologies, trust in democratic processes and institutions, authoritarianism and racial prejudice)? 

- How can long-standing data collection tools such as **mass surveys remain valid and reliable**, as citizens' participation in surveys decline unevenly across demographic and political groups?

I use **Bayesian methods** for computation and inference whenever feasible; see my book, [_Bayesian Analysis for the Social Sciences_](https://www.wiley.com/en-au/Bayesian+Analysis+for+the+Social+Sciences-p-9780470011546).

I appear frequently in Australian and international media discussing developments in US politics and their implications for Australia and other US allies.

Current projects:

- small-area estimation: inferring public opinion at the level of parliamentary seats/districts, postcodes, local government areas etc, from macro-level data.

- machine-learning methods for classifying and modelling large corpora of political text: identifying persuasive and persistent campaign messages and narratives, misinformation and disinformation, counter0narratives.

- Australian public opinion and policy towards the US, Australia's alliance with the US, policy priorities.
