I am a political scientist and a data scientist, with three decades of professional experience as a researcher, teacher, mentor, leader and communicator.

My research and teaching sits at the intersection of the social sciences and statistics.  Questions and problems I work on include

- what predicts how people vote?  Under what conditions do illiberal attitudes and predispositions become drivers of vote choice, such as authoritarianism and racial prejudice?   How much of vote choice is a standing decision based on party loyalty or ideological commitments, or a response to messages from parties and candidates presented during election campaigns?

- assessing and ensure that electoral systems are fair

- rigorously measuring some of the key concepts in political science, such as democracy, ideology, and racial prejudice, ensuring these measures are "fit for purpose" in subsequent analysis and modelling

- adapting long-standing measurement tools such as mass surveys to remain valid and reliable as citizens' willingness to participate in surveys declines, and declines unevenly across demographic and political groups

I use Bayesian methods for computation and inference whenever is feasible.   I wrote a book on the topic (published in 2009) and have many published applications where Bayesian approaches have brought problems out of the "too hard" basket.

I appear frequently in Australian and international media discussing developments in US politics and their implications for Australia and other US allies.

Current projects:

- small-area estimation or "cross-level" inference; 
- machine-learning methods for classification and modeling of text;
- Australian public opinion and policy towards the US, Australia's alliance with the US, policy priorities.

# - 1996 and 2016 I was Professor of Political Science, and, by courtesy, of Statistics, at Stanford University.  
# 
# I am a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (FASSA) and a Fellow and past-president of the Society for Political Methodology.   
# 
# I was one of the principal investigators of the American National Election Studies over the 2012 and 2016 election cycles and is currently one of the principal investigators of the Australian Election Survey, where my interests in politics, research design and data analysis come together.   I work on under-coverage, non-response bias and questionnaire design, so as to improve the validity and reliability of survey based social science.

# 
# My students and research assistants have gone on to careers at the world's leading academic institutions (e.g., Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley, UCLA, Duke, MIT, ANU), business (e.g., Facebook, Netflix, YouGov, Reddit, Morning Consult) and in government.
# 
# I am currently working on problems in (1) small-area estimation or "cross-level" inference; (2) machine-learning methods for classification and modeling of text.
# 
# Between 2016 and 2022, I was Professor and CEO of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, Australia's leading institution for the analysis of the United States.
# 
# Over my career I have consulted for a wide array of media organisations around elections and for a wide range of commercial and NFP organisations, including serving as an expert witness for plaintiffs in gerrymandering litigation in the United States.   Please get in touch if I can be of assistance.
