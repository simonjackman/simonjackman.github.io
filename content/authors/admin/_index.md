I am a political scientist and data scientist, with three decades of professional experience as a researcher, teacher, mentor, leader and communicator.

The **purpose** of my research is to advance democracy, by making discoveries about democratic processes and vulnerabilities through the rigorous analysis of data.

Questions I work on include: 

- When and how do **illiberal attitudes and predispositions** --- such as authoritarianism and racial prejudice --- become politically salient, and with what consequences?  Is vote choice a standing decision that changes little over the life course, based on party loyalty or ideological commitments, or a response to messages from parties and candidates?

- **Are electoral systems fair***, or do they help entrench a particular party or incumbents in office?

- How to rigorously **measure core concepts of democratic theory and practice**, such as democracy itself, electoral fairness, ideology and racial prejudice? 

- How can long-standing data collection tools such as **mass surveys remain valid and reliable**, as citizens' participation in surveys decline unevenly across demographic and political groups?

I use **Bayesian methods** for computation and inference whenever feasible; see my book, _Bayesian Analysis for the Social Sciences_.   I have many published applications where a Bayesian approach brought analysis out of the "too hard" basket.

I appear frequently in Australian and international media discussing developments in US politics and their implications for Australia and other US allies.

Current projects:

- small-area estimation (aka "ecological" or "cross-level" inference); 
- machine-learning methods for classifying and modelling large corpora of political text;
- Australian public opinion and policy towards the US, Australia's alliance with the US, policy priorities.
