summary: >
  After each federal election the Australian Electoral Commission produces a file of counts of voters by the SA1 in which they reside and the polling places at which they turned out for House of Representatives elections. Curiously, summing these counts to the polling place level produces voter turnout counts that do not match the turnout figures published elsewhere by the AEC in official election results. Although the discrepancies are small, better understanding their sources would offer reassurance about election integrity, consistent with the norms of transparency and rigour that are enviable hallmarks of Australian election administration.
