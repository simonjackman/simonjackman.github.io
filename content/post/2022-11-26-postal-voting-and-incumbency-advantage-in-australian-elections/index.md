  "Sophomore surge" is the tendency of incumbents to win more votes in their first bid for re-election relative to their preceding (and successful) candidacy as a challenger, as they acquire the advantages accruing to incumbents: name recognition and public-funded resources chief among them. Sophomore surge seems particularly pronounced for independents and in postal voting, a form of voting becoming more widely used in Australian federal elections.  Incumbents are granted privileged access to a copy of the electoral roll that identifies postal voters _inter alia_ (per ยง90B of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act_).  Incumbents' access and major party experience in exploiting this information is the source of this particular form of incumbency advantage, denied to new entrants to the electoral marketplace.
