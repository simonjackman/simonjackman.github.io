  "Sophomore surge"" is the tendency of incumbent representatives to win more votes in their first bid for re-election relative to their preceding (and successful) candidacy as a challenger, as they acquire the advantages accruing to incumbents: name recognition and public-funded resources chief among them. Sophomore surge seems particularly pronounced for independents and in postal voting, a form of voting becoming more widely used in Australian federal elections. This implies larger incumbency advantages with respect to this form of voting.  We speculate that granting incumbents privileged access to a copy of the electoral roll that identifies postal voters (per §90B of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act_) — and incumbents' and major party experience in exploiting this information — is the source of this advantage, denied to new entrants to electoral marketplace.
