summary: >
  'Survey research undertaken for the United States Studies Centre in December 2021 reveals a United States deeply divided, increasingly isolationist and pessimistic, undergoing substantial democratic backsliding and at risk of more. Specifically: 
  
  - The United States has fallen out of the top 30 liberal democracies, a trend that continues as many Republican-controlled states enact laws making voter registration and turnout burdensome and election administration subject to partisan interference.
  
  - Those who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 are now just as pessimistic about the future of the United States as they were during the Trump administration, while the Republicans’ preferred candidate for the 2024 presidential election remains Donald Trump.
  
  - And, having begun his presidency with a majority of Americans approving of his performance, Biden’s approval ratings in the low 40s are indistinguishable from President Trump’s at the same point in his tenure in office. Amid such pessimism and low approval ratings, President Biden faces the exceedingly likely prospect of his party losing control of both houses of Congress in the November 2022 midterm elections.
  
  - Under Trump, Republican Party supporters have become disproportionately authoritarian and populist.
  
  - Related to the currency, salience and concentration of authoritarianism and populism among Republican voters are historically high levels of isolationism, a profound lack of optimism about the future of the United States, and deep partisan disagreements as to what problems the country faces — at home and abroad — and how to address them.'
