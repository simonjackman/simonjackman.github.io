  At the end of the 2022 Australian federal election campaign, a simple poll average estimated that the Coalition would win 46.5% of the two-party preferred vote.   Correcting for the average level of bias in the five previous elections (2007 to 2019), this estimate was shifted to 47.9% Coalition TPP.   This corrected estimate corresponds _exactly_ to the Coalition's actual result in the 2022 election.
