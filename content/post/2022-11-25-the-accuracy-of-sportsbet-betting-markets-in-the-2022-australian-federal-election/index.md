summary: 'Betting markets are often said to provide more accurate forecasts of elections than polls, despite evidence to the contrary. We contrast the trajectory of Sportsbet’s implied probability that either party would win the 2022 Australian federal election and the performance of Sportsbet’s markets in all 151 House of Representatives seats.'
